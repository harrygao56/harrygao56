## Some Cool Things I've Done Recently

### ðŸ‘‰ speechEasy - AI speech preparation tool

<h4>I worked with 3 friends on this project as our submission to Hack WashU, which placed first overall.</h4>

<h4>SpeechEasy is an AI-powered speech and presentation preparation tool. It uses real-time speech recognition to give you live guidance, letting you know if you are going off-topic and helping you keep within your set time restraints. Additionally, SpeechEasy transcribes your speeches and analyzes them to give you feedback on how you can improve in the future. With technologies such as Flask, React, GPT, AssemblyAI, and Express we aim to empower students and professionals to give precise and polished presentations.</h4>

### ðŸ‘‰ Monet Painting Generator with CycleGAN

<h4>To learn more about generative models and to learn how to deploy models, I created and trained a CycleGAN model to translate photos into Monet paintings. The data was obtained from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/gan-getting-started">this</a> Kaggle competition, where I also submitted the final model.</a></h4>

### ðŸ‘‰ MRI Reconstruction
<h4>As an exploration into machine learning for medical imaging, I implemented a Denoising Neural Network that is trained to remove noise from an MRI scan. It turned out pretty well:</h4>
